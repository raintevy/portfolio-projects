        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
          The purpose of this project was to design a line-following robot.
          We used skills like PCB design, 3-D printing, soldering, Arduino coding,
          and general wiring. We printed our chassis, designed a PCB, and
          implemented it on the robot.

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p>
          We 3-D printed our chassis, designed a PCB, and assembled the system by
          soldering resistors, LEDs, photoresistors, and header pins. The PCB was
          mounted to a light shield on the chassis. Motors, batteries, and
          potentiometers were wired to an Arduino and controlled using custom
          line-following code.

      <p>
        Our line-following robot was successful at completing the competition track. 
        Our robot took accurate and consistent photoresistor readings due to our 3-D printed light shield blocking out light fulling. 
        This allowed the robot to be responsive to any turns in the black line. 
        However, our light shield dragged on the ground as the robot moved, so our speed was reduced. 
        Also, we had difficulty tuning our PID values to be close to ideal values, so our robot tended to have many oscillations as it followed the line.
